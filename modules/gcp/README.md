# ClickHouse BYOC GCP Onboarding Terraform Module

This repository contains Terraform module to bootstrap a BYOC GCP project for ClickHouse Cloud.

## Usage

```hcl
provider "google" {
  project = "replace-with-your-clickhouse-byoc-project-id"
}

module "clickhouse_onboarding" {
  source     = "github.com/ClickHouse/terraform-byoc-onboarding.git//modules/gcp?ref=<version>"
  project_id = "replace-with-your-clickhouse-byoc-project-id"
}
```

Replace `<version>` with the latest tag from the module's
[releases page](https://github.com/ClickHouse/terraform-byoc-onboarding/releases)
— always use the latest release.

### Bring your own VPC (same project)

If you pre-create and manage the VPC network, routes, and Cloud NAT yourself within the BYOC project, set `include_vpc_write_permissions = false`. ClickHouse then does **not** get permissions to create, delete, or modify the network topology (networks, routes, Cloud Routers, subnet attributes), but retains read and use access to it. ClickHouse still creates and manages the resources it owns inside your VPC — the PrivateLink (PSC) service attachment, and ingress/static IP addresses — so PrivateLink and load balancers keep working.

When you bring your own VPC, the PrivateLink PSC NAT subnet is **yours to create**: ClickHouse only observes and uses it. Create it with `purpose = PRIVATE_SERVICE_CONNECT` in the same region and network, with a primary range of at least /29, and give ClickHouse its name when you enable PrivateLink. (On a ClickHouse-managed VPC, ClickHouse creates this subnet for you.)

```hcl
module "clickhouse_onboarding" {
  source                        = "github.com/ClickHouse/terraform-byoc-onboarding.git//modules/gcp?ref=<version>"
  project_id                    = "replace-with-your-clickhouse-byoc-project-id"
  include_vpc_write_permissions = false
}
```

Replace `<version>` with the latest tag from the module's
[releases page](https://github.com/ClickHouse/terraform-byoc-onboarding/releases)
— always use the latest release.

If the VPC you bring instead lives in a **different** project, use the Shared VPC setup below.

### Shared VPC (bring a VPC from a different project)

If the VPC you bring lives in a **different** GCP project (the Shared VPC *host* project) than the BYOC *service* project where ClickHouse runs GKE, set `shared_vpc_host_project_id` (plus the host subnet's `shared_vpc_host_subnet_region` and `shared_vpc_host_private_subnet_id`). The module then grants the network and GKE Shared VPC permissions in the host project, in addition to the standard service-project setup.

```hcl
module "clickhouse_onboarding" {
  source                            = "github.com/ClickHouse/terraform-byoc-onboarding.git//modules/gcp?ref=<version>"
  project_id                        = "replace-with-your-clickhouse-byoc-service-project-id"
  shared_vpc_host_project_id        = "replace-with-your-shared-vpc-host-project-id"
  shared_vpc_host_subnet_region     = "us-central1"
  shared_vpc_host_private_subnet_id = "replace-with-your-host-subnet-name"
}
```

Replace `<version>` with the latest tag from the module's
[releases page](https://github.com/ClickHouse/terraform-byoc-onboarding/releases)
— always use the latest release.

The host project grants are read and use only — ClickHouse never writes to the host project. It observes the brought network and subnet, and uses the PrivateLink PSC NAT subnet you pre-create there (`compute.subnetworks.use`), which is what lets the service attachment in the service project reference it. GKE consumes the host node subnet via a separate `compute.networkUser` binding.

Because a GKE cluster on a Shared VPC has its network in the host project, GKE also creates its firewall rules there — the master→node rule (kubelet/webhook ports) and the load-balancer health-check rules. The module therefore enables the Container API on the host project (so the host project's GKE service agent exists) and grants the service project's GKE service agent a scoped firewall role (`compute.firewalls.*` + `compute.networks.updatePolicy`) in the host project. Without this, admission webhooks and metrics-server degrade and internal load balancers (including the PrivateLink PSC ingress) never become healthy.

**Prerequisites for Shared VPC:**

- The host project must already be enabled as a [Shared VPC host](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/provisioning-shared-vpc) and the service project (`project_id`) attached to it. This is an org-level operation (`compute.xpnAdmin`) and is **not** performed by this module.
- The credentials running this module must have IAM admin on **both** the service project (`project_id`) and the host project (`shared_vpc_host_project_id`).
- If you will use ClickHouse Private Service Connect (PrivateLink), create the PSC NAT subnet in the host project yourself, in the same region and network as the node subnet, with `purpose = PRIVATE_SERVICE_CONNECT` and a primary range of at least /29. ClickHouse only reads and uses it; it will not create it for you. Give its name to ClickHouse when you enable PrivateLink.

## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|:--------:|
| project_id | (Required) The GCP project ID where resources will be provisioned | string | n/a | yes |
| environment | (Optional) Environment. Default is `production`. The other values are reserved for internal use | string | `production` | no |
| include_vpc_write_permissions | (Optional) Whether to grant permissions to manage your VPC network topology (create/delete/modify of networks, routes, Cloud Routers, and subnet attributes). Set to `false` for bring-your-own-VPC onboarding.

| shared_vpc_host_project_id | (Optional) The GCP project ID of the Shared VPC host project, when the VPC you bring lives in a different project than `project_id`. Leave empty for the standard same-project setup. When set, `shared_vpc_host_subnet_region` and `shared_vpc_host_private_subnet_id` are required | string | `""` | no |
| shared_vpc_host_subnet_region | (Optional) The region of the Shared VPC host subnet. Required only when `shared_vpc_host_project_id` is set | string | `""` | no |
